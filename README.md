# Face Recognition System Implementation
![FIRE Logo](assets/logo_fire.PNG) 
## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Python-based, real-time face recognition system designed for dynamic environments, particularly in robotics. The pipeline includes:

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes MediaPipe, YuNet, and RetinaFace to balance speed and accuracy.
- **Face Encoding:** Employs FaceNet128 for speed and FaceNet512 for precision.
- **Face Tracking:** Implements a custom SORT-N algorithm for robust tracking, including non-linear dynamics.
- **Database Management:** Uses SQLite with optional AES-256 encryption for secure storage.
- **Similarity Search:** Integrates HNSWlib for fast and scalable in-memory embedding comparison.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Face Detection

The system incorporates three face detectors:

- **MediaPipe:** Optimized for high-speed detection with acceptable accuracy. Ideal for time-critical applications.
- **YuNet:** Balances accuracy and speed, suitable for applications requiring moderate computational resources.
- **RetinaFace:** Provides the highest accuracy but is computationally intensive, making it more suitable for offline processes.

### 2. Face Encoding

Two variants of FaceNet are used:

- **FaceNet128:** Offers rapid encoding with lower dimensional embeddings, suitable for real-time applications.
- **FaceNet512:** Provides higher precision, ideal for scenarios where accuracy is prioritized over speed.

### 3. Face Tracking

To reduce computational load and maintain identity across frames:

- **SORT-N Algorithm:** Enhances the original SORT algorithm by incorporating:
  - Non-linear motion handling using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).
  - Logarithmic transformations for stable scale and aspect ratio estimation.
  - A combined cost metric using IoU and Euclidean distance for better data association.
  - Expanded state vector with acceleration components for improved handling of abrupt movements.

### 4. Similarity Search

- **HNSWlib:** Enables efficient approximate nearest neighbor search for embeddings, supporting dynamic updates without re-indexing.

### 5. Database Management

- **SQLite:** Lightweight and portable for embedding storage and management.
- **AES-256 Encryption:** Ensures secure handling of sensitive data with salted passwords.

## Performance Metrics

### Detection and Encoding Speed

- **MediaPipe + FaceNet128:** Achieves up to 87.81 FPS in real-time applications.
- **YuNet + FaceNet512:** Balances speed (30+ FPS with frame skipping) and accuracy.
- **RetinaFace:** Suitable for offline use with high AUC of 0.991 but low FPS.

### Accuracy

- Cosine similarity was chosen as the similarity metric, consistently yielding higher AUC scores compared to Euclidean distance.
- Pipelines are evaluated on datasets like CASIA-FaceV5 and open-source videos, demonstrating strong performance in both speed and recognition accuracy.
